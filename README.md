# ML-Learning-Journey

Welcome to the **ML-Learning-Journey** repository! This project is dedicated to documenting my exploration and learning in the field of Machine Learning (ML). Here, I will share code snippets, projects, and insights I gather as I progress through various learning materials and projects.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a personal log of my journey into the world of Machine Learning. It is intended for anyone interested in following along with my progress, as well as those who are learning ML and wish to see practical implementations of various concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Python**: The code here is written in Python, so you'll need Python installed on your machine. It's recommended to use Python 3.7 or later.

2. **Jupyter Notebook**: Many of the code examples will be in Jupyter Notebook format for interactive learning and experimentation. You can install it via Anaconda or using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
